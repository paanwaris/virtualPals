Description: Provides a suite of tools to create virtual species by defining
    their ecological niches as N-dimensional ellipsoids. Users can project
    these niches onto geographic space using environmental raster data to
    generate potential species distributions. Key features include functions
    for generating binary and probabilistic suitability maps and interactive
    3D visualizations of niche space.
