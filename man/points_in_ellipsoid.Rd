\title{Extract Points Within an Ellipsoid}
\usage{
points_in_ellipsoid(ell, points)
}
\arguments{
\item{ell}{An `ellipsoid` object created by `build_ellipsoid()`.}

\item{points}{A matrix or data frame of points to test. The column order
must match the order of variables in the ellipsoid's center.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the rows of `points` that are inside the ellipsoid.
}
\description{
Filters a set of points, returning only those that fall within the boundary
of a given ellipsoid. The determination is made using the squared
Mahalanobis distance.
